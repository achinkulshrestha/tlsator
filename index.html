      <p>SSL Data is encapsulated using the record layer. For most of the SSL stack, a single packet would contain a full record. However, this is not true for Handshake and Application Data protocols. The SSL spec says that only if the record is greater than 2 ^ 14 bytes an exception should be raised. The TCP fragmentation limit is around 1514. Hence, any SSL record greater than 1514 would be sent in two different TCP segments.</p>

<p>Most of the contemporary Packet Parsing libraries assume that an entire ssl record would be seen in a packet otherwise an exception is raised.</p>

<p>TLSator aims at providing a functionality which allows the user to drop record on the fly. The idea is to see how application react on such an event.</p>
